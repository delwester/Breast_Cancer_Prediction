Breast Cancer Malignancy Prediction 

Most types of breast cancer are easy to diagnose by microscopic analysis of a sample - or biopsy - of the
affected area of the breast. The two most commonly used screening methods, physical examination of the
breasts by a healthcare provider and mammography, can offer an approximate likelihood that a lump is cancer,
and may also detect some other lesions, such as a simple cyst. When these examinations are inconclusive, a
healthcare provider can remove a sample of the fluid in the lump for microscopic analysis (a procedure known
as fine needle aspiration, or fine needle aspiration, FNA) to help establish the diagnosis. A needle aspiration
can be performed in a healthcare provider's office or clinic. Together, physical examination of the breasts,
mammography, and FNA can be used to diagnose breast cancer with a good degree of accuracy.
The features for this dataset are computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast
mass. They describe characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the image. I will use this dataset, ML techniques and python to determine
which model has the highest Recall score, which is to say the model that finds the most True Positives.
